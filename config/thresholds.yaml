# PhoenixAuto-Ops: Monitoring Thresholds Configuration
# This YAML file defines the thresholds for various monitoring metrics in the PhoenixAuto-Ops system.
# All values are in percentages (%) or absolute numbers as specified.

thresholds:
  cpu_usage_percent: 80.0       # Alert/Heal if CPU > this value
  memory_usage_percent: 85.0    # Alert/Heal if RAM > this value
  disk_usage_percent: 90.0      # Alert/Heal if Disk (/) > this value
  load_average_limit: 4.0       # 1-minute load average 

# Network related thresholds
network:
  max_connections: 500          # Active TCP connections
  latency_ms: 200               # Round-trip latency in ms

# Self-Healing behavior
auto_healing:
  enabled: true
  dry_run: false                # If true, actions will be logged but not executed
  max_retry_attempts: 3         # How many times to retry an action before giving up
  cooldown_seconds: 300         # Wait time between healing attempts (5 min)
